            <p>
                You've opened and closed the fridge about 4 times now, possibly rummaged through your
                cabinets.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have food, what you lack is the ingenuity to replace those instant noodles with something
                healthy, delicious, and available to you right away. That's where we come in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lets orchestrate dinner
                tonight.
